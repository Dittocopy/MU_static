                                Human resource increasingly gaining significance in the overall development of the country,
                                development of education infrastructure is expected to remain the key focus. Under the current
                                proposed scheme of 'Study in India’, Indian government is aiming to make 10 public and 10
                                private institutions world class. Further, it is also aiming at opening of IIT’s and IIM’s in
                                new locations as well as allocating educational grants for research scholars in most government
                                institutions. Government of India has announced plans to digitize academic records such as
                                degrees, diplomas, mark sheets, migration certificate, skill certificate, etc from secondary to
                                tertiary-level institutions into a National Academic Depository (NAD). It is also signing

                                MOUs with countries for learning, skill training and job assistance. All this for sure spells
                                the Indian government’s motivation to encourage international students to ‘Study in India’. A
                                major prerequisite to this is making the student visa for India application and issuance
                                process completely seamless.<br />


                                <h2>IMMIGRATION & VISA</h2><br />
