                                Studying abroad can be a very exciting thing for most people. It opens doors to new
                                opportunities and at the same time, can be a little bit daunting as it involves staying in an
                                entirely new place for a considerable duration of time. To make the duration of the stay abroad
                                as smooth and memorable and productive as possible, there are certain things a student should
                                keep in mind. Let’s take a look at some of these things:-
        <br><br>
                                <b>Let’s start with the DO’s</b>
                                <br><br>
                                <b>Respect the host nation</b>
                                <br><br>
                                The first and foremost thing to remember at all times is to respect the host nation and its
                                traditions and cultures. This would help you to stay out of unnecessary trouble there and would
                                also help you get in the “good books” of the local people studying with you.
                                <br><br>
                                <b>Ask questions</b>
                                <br>
                                Never be afraid to ask questions whenever needed. This helps to avoid confusion and at the same
                                time, can save you a lot of time and get you desired information first hand. No one is gonna
                                stop you from asking genuine questions, especially when you are a visitor in their country.
                                <br><br>
                                <b> Get to know your locality</b>
                                <br>
                                Whenever you have time to spare, take a walk or interact with the local people over there to
                                get to know about the place where you are staying. This helps you to adapt more easily to the
                                new surroundings and makes living there a positive experience. Try out the local delicacies,
                                visit the nearby popular tourist spots, gardens, etc.
                                <br><br>
                                <b> Cook your own food</b>
                                <br>
                                One of the major concerns is food when going to a foreign country. It is always advisable to
                                learn to cook a few basic nutritious things before going abroad. This is because, having food
                                from outside can turn out to be expensive and frequent outside dining can lead to health
                                problems like obesity, etc.
                                <br><br>
                                <b> Networking</b>
                                <br>
                                Take the extra effort to build networks with people, where you are staying. This is highly
                                beneficial to you in the future because at times of need, you might know the right person to
                                help you out in this way. It can also help you after your course if you are looking for job
                                experience or even a permanent job.
                                <br><br>
                                <b> Take care of your health</b>
                                <br>
                                Health is definitely wealth. Nothing will go right or according to plan if your health fails
                                you, especially when you are without your dear and near ones in a foreign country. Take a
                                health insurance without fail and always make sure that you take care of your physical and
                                mental well-being.
                                <br><br>
                                <b> Stay focused</b>
                                <br>
                                Always keep in mind why you are over there. Remember that you are there for your academics and
                                to help yourself further your goals for the future. So do not bunk classes unnecessarily just
                                because there is no one to bother about it. Make the most of the opportunities you get to
                                interact with the experts in the various fields you come across at the place you are studying.

                                <br><br>


                                <b>Now let’s take a look at the Don’t’s</b>
                                <br><br>
                                <b> Do not overspend.</b>
                                <br>
                                Living abroad can be an a big investment of money. So make sure you do not overspend on
                                unnecessary things. Save money whenever possible for genuine needs which can arise at any time.
                                <br><br>
                                <b> Do not trust everyone you come across</b>
                                <br>
                                While building contacts and networking, make sure you don’t divulge your personal/sensitive
                                information to the people you just met. Part of taking care is knowing how to maintain contacts
                                ina diplomatic way without being taken advantage of.
                                <br><br>
                                <b> Do not get homesick</b>
                                <br>
                                And last, but not the least, do not get homesick and do not let it affect your studies and
                                activities at your new place of stay. Staying away from will definitely make you miss home and
                                your near and dear ones. But always keep in mind why you are there and what your purpose is and
                                continuously strive to achieve your goals.
                                <br><br>


                                Keep the above mentioned things in mind and give it your best shot. If you are sincere in what
                                you are doing, you will definitely have a very positive and invaluable experience, studying
                                abroad. All the best! </p>

What kills me here is that we’re talking about creating a user experience that will (whether we like it or not) be DRIVEN by words. The entire structure of the page or app flow is FOR THE WORDS.
